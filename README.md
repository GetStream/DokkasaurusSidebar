# Dokkasaurus Sidebar

This script creates a `sidebars.js` file from the `.md` files generated from Dokkasaurus. The output contains a JSON mapping the file hierarchy of the documentation. Paste the `sidebars.js` file to a Docussaros project and it will generate the sidebar for your Dokka documentation. 

**This mini CLI need to be used with Dokkasaurus pluggin.**
